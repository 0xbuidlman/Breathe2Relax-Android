<p>This breathing exercise is safe for almost everybody. But if you
		experience any unpleasant sensations, if you have difficulty breathing
		or feeling dizzy, nervous, or out of control, just go back to
		breathing normally. Remember that the purpose of this exercise is to
		help you learn how to slow down and relax. You can shorten or lengthen
		the time of each breath to make it more comfortable for you. Now get
		into a comfortable position in a quiet place that is free from
		distraction. Press start when you are ready to begin the guided exercise.</p>
