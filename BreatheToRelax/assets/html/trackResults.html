	<h1 class="header">Track Results</h1>
	<p>As you breathe to relax you can set how much stress you feel
		before and after the breathing exercise and over time you should see
		how the breathing is helping you reduce stress.</p>
	<p>These graphs display your stress ratings before and after your
		breathing practice. Try to practice every day.</p>
	<h2 class="header">Legend</h2>
	<p>
		The vertical axis of this graph is the recorded stress level (from
		0-100; 0=relaxed, 100=stressed).<br /> The horizontal axis represents
		the day of the selected month.
