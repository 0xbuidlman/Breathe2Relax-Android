	<h1>Immune System</h1>
	<hr />
	The fight or flight response immediately boosts your immune system,
	which would help prevent infection if you were wounded. This short-term
	benefit is offset, though, because in the long run, prolonged stress
	can actually decrease your immune system's ability to fight off illness
	or disease.
