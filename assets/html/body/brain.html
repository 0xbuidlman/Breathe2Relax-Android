	<h1>Brain</h1>
	<hr />
	When you become aware of a threatening situation, your brain sets into
	motion a chain reaction in your body, turning on some systems and
	shutting down others. Adrenaline and stress hormones start pumping
	through your blood stream, affecting how you feel, how you think and
	how you act. And all the time, your brain continues to monitor the
	situation and your body's reaction to it.
